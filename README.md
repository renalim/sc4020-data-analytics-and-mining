# In this project, I achieved the following objectives:
# 1) Investigated the balance between accuracy and efficiency in similarity search using Brute Force K-NN and Approximate Nearest Neighbour (ANN) algorithms.
# 2) Applied PCA for dimensionality reduction, K-Means clustering for pseudo-labeling, and evaluated model performance using Precision@k, nDCG@k, Jaccard Index, and Spearmanâ€™s Rank 
# Correlation across both Breast Cancer and MIMIC-III Clinical datasets.
# 3) Visualized clustering results in 2D using PCA for dimensionality reduction, highlighting algorithmic strengths and limitations on datasets with varying densities.
# 4) Found that Cosine/Angular distance outperforms Euclidean for pattern-based data (e.g., tumor profiles), while Euclidean performs better for magnitude-sensitive clinical data. ANN 
# (Annoy) achieved over 90% retrieval precision with sub-millisecond query time, making it ideal for large datasets.
